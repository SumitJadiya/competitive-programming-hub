The **Blind 75** list is a popular set of 75 coding problems that cover key data structures and algorithms frequently asked in coding interviews. Solving these problems requires familiarity with various **coding patterns** (not to be confused with design patterns). Here is a breakdown of some of the most common coding patterns that are essential for tackling these problems effectively:

### 0. **Substring Problem Pattern**

- **Description**: The Substring Problem Pattern involves finding specific substrings within a larger string based on given criteria. This pattern often requires checking the presence, length, or characteristics of substrings. It frequently employs techniques like the sliding window and two pointers to efficiently explore all possible substrings.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 
  - Find All Anagrams in a String 
  - Minimum Window Substring
