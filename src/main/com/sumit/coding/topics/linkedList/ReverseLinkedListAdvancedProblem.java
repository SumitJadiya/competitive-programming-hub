/*
 *
 * Given a singly linked list with n nodes and two positions, left and right,
 * the objective is to reverse the nodes of the list from left to right.
 * Return the modified list.
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 ≤ n ≤ 500
 * - −5000 ≤ node.data ≤ 5000
 * - 1≤ left ≤ right ≤ n
 *
 * Below are the steps of the algorithm:
 *
 * - We initialize a dummy node, which will be helpful in scenarios where the reversal of the sublist starts from the head of the list.
 * - We set the next node of dummy to point to the head of the list.
 * - We initialize a pointer, prev, to the dummy node. This pointer will help us reconnect the sublist to the entire list after it has been reversed.
 * - We use a loop to traverse the list with the prev pointer and until it reaches the node immediately before the sublist to be reversed.
 * - We initialize a curr pointer, which points to the node next to prev.
 * - Another loop is used to reverse the sublist. This loop iterates right - left times, which is the number of nodes in the sublist minus one:
 *       - We set next_node to curr.next, representing the node to be moved to the front of the reversed sublist.
 *       - We update curr.next to next_node.next, effectively removing next_node from its current position in the sublist.
 *       - We set next_node.next to prev.next, inserting next_node at the beginning of the reversed sublist.
 *       - We update prev.next to next_node, adjusting the pointer to next_node for the next iteration.
 * - Finally, we return dummy.next, which is the head of the modified linked list.
