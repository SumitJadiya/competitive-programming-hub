/*
    Problems with This Code:

	1.	Tight Coupling: The ProductFactory handles the creation of both pizza and drinks in a single class, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
	2.	Complexity: As the number of product types grows, the ProductFactory becomes harder to maintain.
	3.	Lack of Flexibility: Itâ€™s hard to switch to another family of products (e.g., from Italian to Mexican pizzas and drinks) without modifying the factory.
